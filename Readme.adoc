= SecDim's Defensive Programming challenge
Python

== Objective

Find the security vulnerability and effectively fix it.

== Important notes

. Push only to `master` branch.
. Do not modify existing tests. Make the program to follow existing tests specification.
. Tests will be overwritten on the remote server.
. You can add new tests. They will not impact the challenge outcome.

. Install https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[docker] and https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[make] on your system.
. Build the program: `make build`.
. Run functionality tests: `make test`.
. Run security tests: `make securitytest`. This test will fail.
. `make run` to run the program
. `make debug` to live debug program in the container with `src/` mounted from the host.
